# App Store Resubmission Guide - Version 1.0 Fixes

## Current Status: Addressing Second Rejection (October 21, 2025)

### Latest Issue from Apple Review
**Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness**

> Bug description: when the user launches the app, the app shows a continuous spinning indicator on the splash screen page.

**Tested on:** iPad Air (5th generation) and iPhone 13 mini running iPadOS/iOS 26.0.1

### Root Cause
Authentication initialization (Supabase) could hang indefinitely on iOS due to:
1. iOS WebView localStorage restrictions
2. Network requests without timeouts
3. No failsafe to prevent infinite loading states

### Fixes Implemented (October 23, 2025)

#### 1. AuthProvider Timeout Protection (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added 3-second timeout to force loading completion
- Added 2-second timeout to Supabase session fetch
- Enhanced error handling and logging

#### 2. Supabase Client Enhancements (`src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`)
- Storage fallback when localStorage is blocked (iOS WebView)
- 10-second timeout on all fetch requests
- Enhanced auth configuration

#### 3. App Initialization Failsafe (`src/App.tsx`)
- 2-second failsafe timeout to force app ready state
- Proper cleanup and error handling
