## Response to Guideline 4.2 - Design - Minimum Functionality

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback. We would like to clarify that our app provides significant native functionality beyond a web browsing experience:

### Native Features Implemented:

1. **Background Location Tracking** (`src/hooks/use-background-location.ts`)
   - Monitors user location in the background to send notifications about nearby businesses
   - Uses native geofencing for proximity-based alerts
   - This cannot be achieved in a web browser

2. **Native Camera Integration** (`src/components/qr/QRScannerPage.tsx`, `src/hooks/use-qr-scanner.ts`)
   - Direct camera access for QR code scanning with real-time processing
   - Integrated with the loyalty rewards system
   - Provides instant feedback and haptic responses

3. **Push Notifications** (`src/hooks/use-push-notifications.ts`)
   - Remote push notifications for business promotions and loyalty rewards
   - Background notification handling
   - Rich media notifications with action buttons

4. **Advanced App Lifecycle Management** (`src/hooks/use-app-lifecycle.ts`)
   - Deep linking for business pages
   - App state restoration
   - Background task management

5. **Native Haptic Feedback** (`src/hooks/use-haptic-feedback.ts`)
   - Tactile feedback for interactions throughout the app
   - Context-aware haptic patterns

6. **Offline-First Architecture** (`src/hooks/use-offline-support.ts`)
   - Fully functional offline mode with data syncing
   - Local data storage and queue management
   - Background sync when connection restored

7. **Native Status Bar Integration** (`src/components/native/NativeFeatures.tsx`)
   - Dynamic status bar styling based on context
   - Proper handling of notches and safe areas

## Response to Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness

We have identified and fixed both bugs reported during your review:

### Bug 1: Search Field Not Displaying Text
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Text was not visible when entered in the search field on iPad Air 11-inch.

**Root Cause**: Missing explicit text color styling and webkit-specific text fill properties for iPad Safari.

**Fix**: 
- Added explicit `text-gray-900` class and `bg-white` background to search input
- Added inline style with `WebkitTextFillColor: '#111827'` and `opacity: 1` to ensure text visibility on all iOS devices
- File: `src/pages/BusinessesPage.tsx` (line 82-85)

**Testing**: Search field now properly displays typed text on iPad with high visibility.

### Bug 2: QR Scanner Camera Error
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: QR Scanner showed error message instead of camera permission prompt.

**Root Cause**: 
- Insufficient error handling for camera permission requests
- Missing device-specific camera constraints for iPad
- No graceful fallback for permission denials

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Enhanced camera permission handling with specific error types (`NotAllowedError`, `PermissionDeniedError`, `NotFoundError`)
2. Improved camera stream configuration with iPad-optimized resolution (1280x720)
3. Added proper async/await for video element play() method
4. Implemented user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
5. Better permission state management

**Files Updated**:
- `src/hooks/use-qr-scanner.ts` (lines 66-121, 157-177)
- `src/components/qr/QRScannerPage.tsx` (lines 46-76)

**Testing**: QR Scanner now:
- Properly prompts for camera permission on first use
- Displays specific error messages for different failure types
- Gracefully handles permission denials
- Works correctly on iPad Air 11-inch (M3) with iPadOS 26.0.1

### Location:
1. Navigate to Settings (accessible from main navigation)
2. Select "User Settings" 
3. Tap the "Account" tab
4. Two deletion options are available:
   - "Request Account Deletion" (with 30-day review period)
   - "Delete Account Immediately" (instant permanent deletion)

### Implementation Details:
- **File**: `src/pages/UserSettingsPage.tsx` (lines 134-136)
- **Component**: `src/components/auth/AccountDeletion.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Clear explanation of what data will be deleted
  - Optional reason field for user feedback
  - Confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletion
  - Immediate sign-out after deletion
  - Backend functions to remove all user data from database

### What Gets Deleted:

The account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Users are clearly informed of this before confirming.

### Testing Instructions for Reviewers:

3. Choose either deletion option
4. For immediate deletion: confirm in the dialog
