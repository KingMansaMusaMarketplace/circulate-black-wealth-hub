## Issues Addressed

### ✅ Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness (Video Bug)

**Issue:** Video content failed to load on iPad Air 11-inch (M3) running iPadOS 26.0.1

**Root Cause:**
The YouTube video player was using:
1. Invalid `origin` parameter in iOS WebView context
2. Standard YouTube domain which has stricter embedding policies
3. Insufficient fallback mechanisms for iOS devices

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Removed iOS WebView-incompatible parameters**
   - Removed `origin` parameter that fails in Capacitor WebViews
   - Removed `enablejsapi` which requires CORS support
   - Simplified parameter set to iOS-compatible subset

2. **Switched to YouTube Privacy-Enhanced Mode**
   - Changed from `youtube.com` to `youtube-nocookie.com`
   - Better compatibility with restrictive environments
   - Enhanced privacy compliance

3. **Added Visible Fallback Button**
   - "Watch on YouTube" button overlaid on every video
   - Direct link to YouTube app/website if embed fails
   - Ensures video content is always accessible

**Files Updated:**
- `src/components/VideoPlayer/YouTubePlayer.tsx`

**Testing Performed:**
- ✅ Tested on iPad Pro 12.9" (iOS 17)
- ✅ Tested on iPhone 14 Pro (iOS 17)
- ✅ Tested in Safari WebView context
- ✅ Verified fallback button functionality
- ✅ All videos load and play correctly
