Dear Apple Review Team,

Thank you for reviewing Mansa Musa Marketplace. We have provided two demo accounts for testing all features of the app:

**Customer Account (For testing customer features):**
- Email: customer.demo@mansamusa.com
- Password: CustomerDemo123!

**Business Account (For testing business owner features):**
- Email: demo@mansamusa.com
- Password: Demo123!

### Testing Instructions:

**With the Customer Account, you can:**
- Browse the business directory
- Scan QR codes at participating businesses (or use the manual entry option in the scanner)
- View loyalty rewards and points
- Track community impact statistics
- View transaction history

**With the Business Account, you can:**
- Access the business dashboard
- View sample transactions and analytics
- Generate QR codes for customer scanning
- Manage business profile and settings
- View customer engagement metrics

### Camera Permission:
The app will request camera access for QR code scanning. This is used solely for scanning loyalty QR codes at Black-owned businesses. You can also test the app without granting camera permission by using the manual entry option in the scanner.

### Location Permission:
The app will request location access to show nearby businesses in the directory. This is optional and the app functions fully without it.

All features are fully functional with these demo accounts. If you have any questions or need additional information, please let us know.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Mansa Musa Marketplace Team
