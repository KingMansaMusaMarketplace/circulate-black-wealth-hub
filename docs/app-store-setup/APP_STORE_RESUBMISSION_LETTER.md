**Resolution:**
- Switched YouTube embeds to `youtube-nocookie.com` for improved iOS compatibility
- Removed WebView-incompatible parameters (`origin`, `enablejsapi`)
- Added visible "Watch on YouTube" fallback button for all video content
- Tested successfully on iPad Pro 12.9", iPhone 14 Pro, and Safari WebView environments

**Files Modified:** `src/components/VideoPlayer/YouTubePlayer.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed (Demo Account)

**Issue:** Demo account credentials were not clearly provided

**Resolution:**
We have created a fully-featured demo account with pre-populated data:

**Demo Credentials:**

### 3. ✅ Guideline 2.3.7 - Accurate Metadata (Screenshot Pricing)

**Issue:** App Store screenshots contained pricing references ("FREE", promotional text, etc.)

**Resolution:**
- All screenshots have been updated to remove pricing references
- Removed: "Free for Customers", "FREE rewards", "No cost to join" text
- iPad and iPhone screenshots now comply with metadata guidelines
- Pricing information is only mentioned in the app description as permitted
