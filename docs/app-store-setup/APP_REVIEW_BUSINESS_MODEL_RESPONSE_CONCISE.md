# App Review Business Model Response (Concise Version)

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your inquiry. Please find answers below:

### 1. Who are the users that will use the paid subscriptions?

**A) Business Owners** - Black-owned businesses that want to list their business, access loyalty program features, receive analytics, and get enhanced visibility.

**B) Sponsors/Partners** - Organizations that want to support Black-owned businesses, gain community visibility, and access partnership opportunities.

**Regular customers use the app completely FREE until January 2026** - they discover businesses, earn loyalty points, and redeem rewards without payment. Business subscriptions fund this free access.

### 2. Where can users purchase subscriptions?

**On iOS**: ALL subscriptions purchased exclusively through Apple's In-App Purchase system via StoreKit. Full IAP compliance implemented.

**On web**: Subscriptions purchased through our website using Stripe.

**Important**: The iOS app contains NO links to external payments, does NOT bypass Apple's IAP, and offers NO alternative payment options.

### 3. What subscription types can users access?

**For Businesses:**
- Basic Business ($29.99/month): Business listing, basic analytics, loyalty program
- Premium Business ($79.99/month): Enhanced visibility, priority support, advanced analytics
- Enterprise Business ($199.99/month): Multiple locations, custom branding, API access

**For Sponsors:**
- Community Sponsor ($99.99/month): Community badge, basic visibility
- Corporate Sponsor ($499.99/month): Premium placement, analytics, partnership tools

Subscription status verified server-side through Apple App Store receipts (iOS) and Stripe (web).

### 4. What paid features don't use in-app purchase?

**NONE on iOS**. Every paid feature in the iOS app requires an active Apple In-App Purchase subscription.

Web subscriptions via Stripe are separate B2B services for marketplace listing/analytics - not digital content consumed on iOS. The iOS app recognizes both sources but only offers Apple IAP for new purchases.

### 5. Are services sold to consumers or for family use?

Our subscriptions are **B2B (Business-to-Business)** sold to:
- Individual business owners operating companies
- Business managers managing multiple locations
- Corporate sponsors representing organizations

These are NOT consumer/family subscriptions. They provide professional services: business listing tools, analytics dashboards, customer relationship features, and marketing services. Each subscription ties to a single business entity or organization.
