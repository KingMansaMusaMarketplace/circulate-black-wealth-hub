## NATIVE MOBILE FEATURES (Guideline 4.2 Compliance)

This application provides **significant native functionality** that cannot be replicated in a web browser. It is NOT a simple web wrapper - it is a feature-rich native mobile application that leverages iOS capabilities to provide a superior user experience.

### 1. üîî PUSH NOTIFICATIONS (`@capacitor/push-notifications`)

**Implementation:** Full APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) integration with background notification handling.

**Native Features:**
- Real-time business promotion alerts sent even when app is closed
- Nearby business discovery notifications using geolocation data
- Transaction confirmations with haptic feedback
- Loyalty point earned/redeemed notifications
- Event reminder alerts with deep linking
- QR code scan success confirmations

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Grant notification permissions when prompted
2. Background the app or close it completely
3. Trigger a notification (scan QR code, earn loyalty points, or proximity to business)
4. Observe native iOS notification banner with custom actions

**Why This Can't Be Done in Safari:**
- Web browsers cannot send push notifications when the browser is closed
- Web notifications don't integrate with iOS notification center
- No background notification processing in web apps

---

### 2. üìç BACKGROUND LOCATION SERVICES (`@capacitor/geolocation`)

**Implementation:** Continuous background location monitoring with battery-efficient geofencing.

**Native Features:**
- Automatic nearby Black-owned business detection (even when app is backgrounded)
- Location-based business recommendations within radius
- "You're near a Black-owned business!" push notifications
- Distance calculations for directory search results
- Automatic city/region detection for localized content

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Grant location permissions ("Allow While Using App" or "Always Allow")
2. Navigate to Business Directory
3. Observe automatic location detection and nearby businesses
4. Background the app and move 0.5+ miles
5. Receive notification about new nearby businesses

**Why This Can't Be Done in Safari:**
- Mobile Safari cannot access location when backgrounded
- Web apps don't have geofencing capabilities
- No persistent location tracking in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

---

### 3. üì≥ HAPTIC FEEDBACK ENGINE (`@capacitor/haptics`)

**Implementation:** Tactile responses using iOS Taptic Engine for enhanced user interaction.

**Native Features:**
- Medium impact haptic on successful QR code scan
- Light impact haptic on button taps and interactions
- Heavy impact haptic on transaction confirmations
- Notification-style haptic on loyalty point milestones
- Selection haptic feedback for picker/slider controls

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Navigate to QR Scanner (`/qr-scanner`)
2. Scan any QR code (test QR codes provided on home page)
3. Feel distinct haptic feedback on successful scan
4. Tap various buttons throughout app - notice subtle feedback
5. Complete a transaction - feel confirmation haptic

**Why This Can't Be Done in Safari:**
- Mobile web has NO access to iOS Haptic/Taptic Engine
- Web Vibration API is severely limited and doesn't support Taptic patterns
- Safari blocks most vibration API calls for privacy/battery reasons
