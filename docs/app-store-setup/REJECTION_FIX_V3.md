## ðŸš¨ Issues Identified

### 1. âœ… FIXED - Guideline 2.1: Unresponsive Buttons on iPad
**Issue:** "Start free trial" and "Browse directory" buttons unresponsive on iPad Air (5th gen) with iPadOS 26.0.1

**Root Cause:**
- Motion.div wrappers with `whileHover` and `whileTap` were blocking touch events on iPad
- Missing `touchAction: 'manipulation'` CSS property for iOS touch optimization
- Event propagation issues with nested interactive elements

**Solution Implemented:**
- âœ… Removed problematic `motion.div` wrappers around buttons
- âœ… Added `touchAction: 'manipulation'` to all buttons and links for proper iOS touch handling
- âœ… Added `pointer-events: none` to decorative elements to prevent interference
- âœ… Added `cursor-pointer` class for visual feedback
- âœ… Replaced `whileHover`/`whileTap` with CSS `transition-transform` and `:hover` pseudo-classes
- âœ… Added explicit `<span>` wrappers with `pointer-events-none` to prevent child element interference

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Hero.tsx` - Fixed "Browse Directory" and "Join FREE Today" buttons
- `src/components/HowItWorks/CTASection/CTAButtons.tsx` - Fixed both CTA buttons
- `src/components/subscription/SubscriptionPlans.tsx` - Fixed "Start Free Trial" buttons
- `src/components/subscription/SubscriptionPlansWithToggle.tsx` - Fixed subscription buttons

### 2. âœ… COMPLETED - Guideline 2.3.3: iPad Screenshots
**Issue:** 13-inch iPad screenshots show stretched iPhone images

**Solution:**
- âœ… Created proper iPad screenshots at 2048 x 2732 px using appscreens.com
- âœ… Used screenshot mode: `?screenshot=true`
- âœ… Screenshots accurately represent iPad layout (not stretched)

**Recommended Pages:**
- Home/Hero page
- Business Directory
- QR Scanner (if available on iPad)
- Dashboard
- Business Profile page

---
