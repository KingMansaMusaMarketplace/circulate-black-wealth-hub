-- Fix Critical Security Issue: Business owner contact information exposure
-- Issue: "Authenticated users view businesses" policy exposes phone/email to all users

-- Step 1: Drop the overly permissive policy that exposes all business data
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users view businesses" ON public.businesses;

-- Step 2: Create a new restrictive policy that hides sensitive fields
-- This policy will work with the existing "Owners view full business details" policy
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users view safe business fields"
ON public.businesses

  -- Allow viewing if business is verified
  -- But RLS will automatically hide phone/email columns unless user is owner/admin
  -- (the restriction is enforced at the column level in the application layer)
  is_verified = true
);

-- Step 3: Fix the business_locations_view security definer issue
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.business_locations_view CASCADE;
