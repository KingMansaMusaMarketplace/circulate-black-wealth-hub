      question: "Why do I need to pay a subscription?",
      answer: "Your subscription directly supports the ongoing development and maintenance of the platform. It also enables us to provide valuable discounts, loyalty programs, and other services. Subscriptions help us create a sustainable model that benefits both customers and businesses in the community."
    },
    {
      question: "How do businesses get verified?",
      answer: "We verify businesses through a thorough process that includes confirming business registration documents, validating Black ownership (51% or more), and checking business address and contact information. This ensures that all businesses on our platform meet our standards for quality and authenticity."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the app in any city?",
      answer: "Yes! Our marketplace is designed to work anywhere, though the density of participating businesses will vary by location. We're actively expanding our network of businesses across the country, with a focus on major urban areas first."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I redeem my loyalty points?",
      answer: "Loyalty points can be redeemed directly through the app. Simply visit the Rewards section, browse available rewards from participating businesses, and select the one you'd like to redeem. You'll receive a confirmation code that can be used at the business."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a business closes or leaves the platform?",
      answer: "If a business closes or leaves the platform, we'll notify members who have earned points with that business. Typically, you'll have a grace period to redeem any accumulated points before they expire. We also work to connect members with similar businesses in the area."
