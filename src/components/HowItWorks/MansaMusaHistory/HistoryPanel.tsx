        <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
          In the 14th century, Mansa Musa ruled the Mali Empire with wealth that, adjusted for inflation, would make him the richest person in history. His empire controlled more than half the world's supply of gold and salt.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
          During his famous pilgrimage to Mecca in 1325, he distributed so much gold along his journey that he temporarily collapsed the value of gold in Egypt.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
          What's remarkable wasn't just his wealth, but how he used it - building universities, mosques, and infrastructure that created lasting prosperity for his kingdom and people.
        </p>
        <p className="text-foreground/90">
          Along his trade routes, Mansa Musa established rest houses and way stations — early forms of hospitality infrastructure — ensuring that travelers and merchants were welcomed, sheltered, and connected to local economies wherever they journeyed.
